Question 1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, 
you need to understand what users want and how they will use the program. User stories, which are simple descriptions of desired functionality from the user's perspective, help with this by capturing specific requirements and guiding the development process.

Question 2: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When approaching program development, it's important to follow agile processes. These processes prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. 
By incorporating agile practices like Scrum or Kanban, you can adapt to changing requirements, involve stakeholders throughout the process, and deliver working software in smaller, frequent increments.

Question 3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means collaborating effectively and contributing to the team's success. It involves open communication, sharing knowledge, 
being responsive to feedback, and taking ownership of tasks. Good team members also value teamwork, respect diverse perspectives, and actively participate in the project's goals and objectives.
